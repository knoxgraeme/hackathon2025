  "transcript": "Hi there! I need help planning a photo shoot. We're doing an engagement session in San Francisco next Saturday, January 25th. We'd like to start around 4:30 PM to catch golden hour. My fianc√©e Sarah and I want something romantic but also fun and candid - not too posed. We're thinking about 2 hours should be enough. We'd love to hit some iconic spots but also some hidden gems if you know any. We're pretty flexible on locations but would prefer them to be relatively close together since we don't want to spend too much time driving. Oh, and we're bringing our golden retriever Max - he's part of the family! Any specific shots we want? Definitely some with the Golden Gate Bridge in the background, and maybe some casual coffee shop vibes. I'm not a professional photographer but I've been shooting for a few years now, so I'd say intermediate level. Do we need any special permits for these locations?"
