      "name": "Gastown - Alleyways off Water Street (e.g., Blood Alley Square)",
      "address": "Approx. 110 Blood Alley Square, Vancouver, BC V6B 1C7",
      "description": "Cobblestone alleyways framed by historic brick buildings, grimy textures, fire escapes, and atmospheric lighting. Golden hour light creates long dramatic shadows and highlights architectural details, perfect for a gritty, urban musician portrait seeking a moody and dramatic album cover.",
      "bestTime": "Golden hour, just before sunset",
      "lightingNotes": "Soft, directional golden light from the west, creating strong contrast and deep shadows in the narrow alleys. Utilize the brick walls as natural reflectors or for interesting texture. Can be quite dark in deeper sections.",
      "accessibility": "Metered street parking nearby (can be scarce). Easy access via SkyTrain (Waterfront Station) or bus. Primarily flat walking once there.",
      "permits": "Generally no permit needed for outdoor public photography with small setups. Large crews or disruptive equipment may require a permit from the City of Vancouver. Be mindful of pedestrian traffic.",

      "description": "Descending into the sunken Quarry Garden, dramatic rock faces, diverse plant life, and hidden nooks offer a secluded, almost mystical backdrop. Golden hour light filters through trees, creating dappled shadows and highlighting rugged textures, perfect for a contemplative, moody feel for an album cover.",
      "bestTime": "Golden hour, as light skims the rock faces",
      "lightingNotes": "Dappled light filtering through trees, creating patches of light and shadow. The quarry walls can act as natural light traps or reflectors. Look for pockets of direct golden light hitting the rock formations.",
      "accessibility": "Free parking available within the park or surrounding streets. Easily accessible by bus (Cambie St.) or Canada Line (Oakridge-41st Ave Station, short walk). Requires walking down paths to the garden floor.",
      "permits": "Generally no permit needed for small-scale personal/professional photography. Large commercial shoots may require a permit from the Vancouver Park Board.",

      "address": "578 Carrall St, Vancouver, BC V6B 5K2",
      "description": "Serene pathways, intricate architecture, and reflective jade-green ponds create an ethereal, timeless atmosphere. Golden hour light casts long shadows and soft highlights, emphasizing the traditional elements and offering dramatic reflections for a moody and evocative album cover. A beautiful, quiet escape.",
      "bestTime": "Golden hour, approaching closing time (check seasonal hours)",
      "lightingNotes": "Soft, diffused light under covered walkways; dramatic reflections on the pond surfaces. Golden hour will add warmth and depth, enhancing shadows from intricate carvings. Ideal for moody portraits with a sense of calm.",
      "accessibility": "Limited street parking nearby, paid parking lots in Chinatown. Easy access via SkyTrain (Stadium-Chinatown Station) or bus. Garden pathways are accessible. Entrance fee required.",
      "permits": "Commercial photography and use of tripods require a permit and fees. You must inquire directly with the garden management for professional shoots in advance.",

      "name": "Stanley Park - Under Lions Gate Bridge (North side, Prospect Point area)",
      "address": "Near Prospect Point Lookout, Stanley Park Dr, Vancouver, BC V6G 1Z4",
      "description": "The monumental concrete pylons and steel structure of the Lions Gate Bridge create a stark, dramatic backdrop. Water and natural elements combined with the bridge's imposing scale offer a powerful, industrial-meets-nature aesthetic, perfect for a musician seeking a bold, moody album cover at golden hour.",
      "bestTime": "Golden hour, looking towards the setting sun for rim lighting",
      "lightingNotes": "Can be shadowed by the bridge structure; however, golden hour light can skim the concrete and steel, creating dramatic highlights and silhouettes. Look for open spots where light hits the subject and the bridge elements.",
      "accessibility": "Paid parking at Prospect Point. Can be accessed by walking/cycling the seawall, or driving to Prospect Point. Requires some walking on paths down to the water's edge or under the bridge.",
