# Photo Session Sharing Feature

This feature allows photographers to share their completed photo sessions with clients, models, or other collaborators through a read-only link.

## Features

### 1. Share Button
- Located in the header of completed photo sessions
- Shows a share icon (upload arrow) next to the refresh button
- Only visible for sessions with `status: 'complete'`

### 2. QR Code Modal
- Displays when the share button is clicked
- Shows a QR code that can be scanned to access the shared session
- Includes a copyable share link
- Uses a free QR code API service (qr-server.com)

### 3. Shared Session Page
- Read-only version of the session page
- Located at `/share/[sessionId]`
- Shows all session content including:
  - Storyboard images
  - Shoot plan with locations
  - Equipment requirements
  - Special requests
  - Session timeline
- Includes "Read Only" indicator in the header
- Same navigation between storyboard and plan views

## How It Works

1. **Creating a Share Link**: When a photographer clicks the share button, the system generates a unique URL pointing to `/share/[sessionId]`

2. **QR Code Generation**: The QR code is generated using the qr-server.com API, which creates a QR code image that links to the share URL

3. **Accessing Shared Sessions**: Anyone with the link can view the session content, but cannot edit or modify anything

4. **Data Source**: Currently loads session data from localStorage (in production, this would be from a public API endpoint)

## Security & Privacy

- **Public Access**: Anyone with the link can view the session
- **Read-Only**: Shared sessions cannot be modified
- **No Authentication**: No login required to view shared sessions
- **Session Status**: Only completed sessions can be shared

## Implementation Details

### Routes
- `/share/[id]` - Public share page for session viewing

### Components
- `QRCodeModal` - Modal component for displaying QR code and share link
- `SharePage` - Read-only session viewing page

### API Integration
- Uses qr-server.com free API for QR code generation
- No backend database required (uses localStorage for demo)

## Usage

1. Complete a photo session until it reaches `status: 'complete'`
2. Click the share button (â†—) in the session header
3. Copy the link or scan the QR code
4. Share with clients, models, or collaborators
5. Recipients can view the full session plan and storyboard

## Future Enhancements

- Add expiration dates for shared links
- Password protection for sensitive sessions
- Analytics to track who viewed shared sessions
- Export to PDF functionality
- Custom branding for shared sessions
- Email sharing integration
